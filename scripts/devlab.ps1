Options:
-l <lang> - Language devlab to be started. Default: Python and Julia
-v <version> - Version of the language devlab to be started. Default: latest

<command> can be one of:
devlab [-l <lang>] [-v <version>] <command>

<command> can be one of:
tmux - Starts a zsh shell with tmux
lab - Starts the jupyter lab
nb OR notebook - Starts the jupyter notebook
shell - Starts (or connects to a running) devlab with a zsh shell without tmux
stop - Stops the started jupyter (lab or notebook)

If no command is given, default is "lab".
